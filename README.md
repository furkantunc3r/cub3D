# cub3D
The project's aim is creating a 3D maze in which the player can move in four directions with keyboard and mouse input. This project was made with Ray-Casting method and the DDA algorithm.

# Personal Notes
I have always been a gamer and had interest in game development. Prior to Cub3D I had only developed a 2D game. I had the most fun, and also the hardest time with this project among all others.
