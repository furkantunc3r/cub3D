# cub3D

The project's aim is creating a 3D maze in which the player can move in four directions with keyboard and mouse input. This project was made with Ray-Casting method and the DDA algorithm.

# Personal Notes

I have always been a gamer and had interest in game development. Prior to Cub3D I had only developed a 2D game. I had the most fun, and also the hardest time with this project among all others.

This was a group(2) project.

I was involved in the ray-cast, minimap, texture addition, and pixel drawing components of the project. I also contributed to fixing the fish-eye effect that comes with the ray-casting method.

I had to dive deep into the functions of the libray we used, that is the MLX libray, in order to understand how to draw lines in the screen. With help from the internet, I figured that I needed to use lots
of mathematical calculations to be able to create a pseudo 3D environment. The DDA algorithm was helpful in this situation. We could have also used the Bresenham's algorithm but we favored precision over performance,
so we picked the DDA.

In the end, we created a 3D maze in which the player can move and get lost. This project helped me significantly to understand how the games we play actually work behind the scenes.
